# Overview
---
PSMS or Project Status Monitoring System is web-based application that allows agencies in effectively monitoring their projects on demand with the  necessity of asking or gathering data from each project-in-charge manually.

## Key Points

The following are the key points that are focused on by this application.

### Account for Each PIC

Each PIC (`Project-In-Charge`) of a contract will have their own account. This improves speed in gathering data and less prone to data-gathering errors.

### Inspector and Accounting User Types

`Inspector` is the user type for PIC. To add the financial component, `Accounting` user type is also present for the data of fund and expenditures.

### Computed Data

To ease the engineers for contract/project element calculations, various data are automatically generated by the system (e.g. `S-Curve`, `Statement of Time Elapsed`, `Project List Summary`, etc.).
